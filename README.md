This is a Portfolio site I made for myself,
using React.

It has some dynamic elements 
  - using hooks for the greeting on the Home page
  - A responsive Navbar
  - the use of React-router-dom to switch between pages

To be added...
  - a projects page, with pictures of past projects (*DONE!)
  - responsive styling for smaller screens (*DONE!)
